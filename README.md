# weStory
A collaborate story building game, created by Vivian Lee, Ziyin Zhang, and Jonathan King

Project Description:
The title of our project is WeStory, which is a collaborative story building game where
two players work together to create a story based on a prompt given. The basic premise is that
players will be given a topic or a simple story line, and it is up to them to write a coherent story
in the following pattern ­ Player A begins to write a sentence, but leaves the sentence unfinished
for player B. Player B then finishes Player A’s sentence and starts another sentence. Then player
A finishes player B’s sentence and so on. The game aspect of this story comes from the timed
nature of the program, where the players have a certain amount of time to come up with a story
based on the topics given.
After finishing the story, if the players wish, they can post the story to
www.we­story.tumblr.com after giving their story a title.
